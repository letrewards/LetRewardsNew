# LetRewards


Hosted on Pagodabox.io

I have been uploading it to Pagodabox via Git using a tool called Sourcetree. To make updates yourself,
download Sourcetree.

Once you have done that, open Sourcetree and clone the Url from the Admin page of the Pagoda account:
git@git.pagodabox.io:apps/letrewards.git 

This should create a copy on your computer that you can manipulate. Any time you want to push updates, 
select the checkbox "Unstaged files", then write a message about what you are changing. Don't forget to 
check the box under that says "Push changes immediately to origin/master."

Go to the link and click “Download Zip” on the bottom of the right sidebar. https://github.com/christaclark/LetRewards

From there, you still need to clone the Pagodabox repository onto your desktop, using Sourcetree. I’ll try to walk you through it with pictures. 

So Open sourcetree and find “+New Repository” then click “Clone from URL”

You will then paste the Pagodabox link, below in the “Source URL”.
git@git.pagodabox.io:apps/letrewards.git

Define where you want the repository to live in your computer, ideally somewhere easy to get to. I use my “Github” or “Sites” folders depending on what I’m working on. 

Once you create the file, drop all of the components from the Github ZIP file I mentioned at the beginning of the email. 

From there you can change the code around. I recommend using the application Sublime, it’s my favorite text/code editor.

Next go back to Sourcetree and click on the LetRewards repository. You should get a wind that looks like this. Notice how “staged files” is currently checked. You need to click “Unstaged files” to put the changes into queue. 

Lastly, write in a “Commit Message,” this is where you describe the changes you made.

Then, most importantly, make sure the “Push changes” is checked. It’s a little box at the bottom. Hit Commit when you are done and it will push everything to the Pagodabox and makes the changes for you. It will take a few minutes, so check on it in 5 minutes or so. 

Let me know if you need clarification.
